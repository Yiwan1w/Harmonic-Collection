    <p>I have been to Hong Kong three times in total. The first time was in 2011, the second time was in 2019, and the third time was in 2023, which were distributed at different stages of my growth.</p>
    <p>which were distributed at different stages of my growth.
        Why do I call Hong Kong a small world? It is the most integrated and inclusive of the international cities I have been to. I have lived in Shanghai since I was a child and now go to school in New York. I still feel like the two cities are dominated by the people who belong to that area. And Hong Kong gives me a feeling that everyone belongs there, or that no one belongs there. There are various cultures and various skin colors in this small piece of land, which is like a condensed world.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s food, architectural style, various alleys, bustling Causeway Bay, the night view of Victoria Harbor, and Disneyland all deeply attracted me. Looking back at the past three journeys is really a wonderful experience. It seems that the little things in the past are vividly enriching my understanding of the city and witnessing my growth.</p>

        <h5>In 2023, for visiting one of my best high school friends.</h5>
        <p>This time I went to Hong Kong alone. I took a 14-hour long-distance flight from New York to Hong Kong to visit my good friends in high school. My friend is currently studying at the University of Hong Kong. At the same time, this is also my first time visiting a Hong Kong university after many visits to Hong Kong.</p>
        <p>Under the guidance of a friend, I visited her school and listened to her talk about her current college life. Together with her, I missed the life together every day in high school. When we meet after a year of separation, there are always endless things to talk about.</p>

        <h5>Walking through the same place again in 2023 where I came here before in 2019</h5>
        <p>The photos are all around Sogo Plaza in the center of Causeway Bay. The larger photo was taken in May 23, and the photo in the lower right corner was taken in January 2019.</p>
        <p>This is one of my favorite places in Hong Kong. Every time I travel, I always stay around Causeway Bay because of the bustling surroundings, shopping malls, convenient transportation and delicious food. It was interesting to discover that a small part of the billboard on the building is still there.</p>
