                <p1 class="2">Shanghai is my home and I grew up here. Perhaps it’s the city’s vibrant energy that has shaped my curiosity about everything around the world.</p>
                <p2 class="3">18 years of growth makes me love everything here and feel a little bored. The meaning of travel may be born in this that travelling can transition every long chapter in my life and allow me to take a rest in the hustle of city life and to be ready to start a new episode.</p>

                    <p11 class="22">When I was a child, or before I was sensible, my parents took me on trips to experience the wider world. I did not have my unique understanding of traveling and thought it was going out for fun superficially.</p>
                    <p22 class="33">When I grew up, after reading "The Story of the Sahara" by San Mao三毛, a female writer from Taiwan, I had the impulse and obsession to visit a place for the first time in my life. It was also during my own journey to the Sahara that I felt the great solace brought by nature. Since then, I have gradually formed my own concept of travel. It doesn’t need to be too refined, it can be aimless wandering.</p>
